# IOT Smart Water Control System using Arduino Node MCU ESP32 with Flutter Mobile Application

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) system designed to monitor and control water usage efficiently. The system integrates various components to automate water flow and track water levels, ensuring optimal resource management. The solution features a mobile app built with Flutter for remote monitoring and control.

## Key Features
- Real-time Water Monitoring: Track water consumption in real-time.

- Automated Control: Automates water flow based on predefined settings.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: The app is built using Flutter, making it available on Android, iOS, and Web platforms for easy accessibility.

- User-friendly Interface: Uses an LCD display and keypad for direct interaction with the system.

## Key Technologies and Components
- NodeMCU ESP32: This microcontroller ensures seamless communication and control within the system, managing both user inputs and outputs. It's the heart of the system, enabling connectivity with the internet and other devices.

- Firebase Database: Provides real-time data storage and retrieval, ensuring users can access up-to-date information on their water management system at any time, from anywhere.

- Flutter Mobile App: Developed to allow users to monitor and manage water usage remotely. The app displays real-time water levels and system status, ensuring that users can access information and control the system from anywhere.

- Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures and tracks water levels with precision, providing accurate data for the system and users, enabling better water resource management.

- 16x4 LCD Display & 4-Pin Keypad: These components provide a straightforward and intuitive interface for direct user interaction with the system. The keypad allows users to make changes or input commands easily.

## How It Works
- Water Level Detection: The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the water levels and sends data to the ESP32.

- Data Storage & Retrieval: The ESP32 communicates with the Firebase database to store the real-time water level data.

- User Interaction: The Flutter mobile app provides users with real-time updates, while the LCD and keypad offer direct control options.

- Automated Water Flow: Based on user settings, the system automatically adjusts the water flow to optimize usage.

## Conclusion
This IoT-based water control system helps in efficient water management by automating the control and monitoring process. The system is scalable and can be adapted to various applications, such as home automation, agriculture, and industrial water management.
